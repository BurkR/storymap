In this lab, you are asked to make a storymap using the library storymap.js. This storymap.js library is hosted at https://github.com/jakobzhao/storymap. Your storymap will at least have the following features:

In the readme file, please describe the storyline of your story map. You may refer to the lecture notes on three-action (step, confrantation, and resolution). (10 POINTS)

The story line begins with defining a Culturally Significant plant and shows an interactive map of vegetation and federally administered lands. This interactive map is centered on Corvallis and you can zoom out and click on the map, a pop up with info will appear.   

The next slide shows a cultural landscape and the map is centered on where the photo was taken on Bureau of Land Management lands. 

The next scene is of the most famous or (like the mascot) of Culturally Significant Plants. The Photo was taken of a camas just beginning to bloom a mile south of Oregon State University campus. The map shows the distribution of camas from a CVS provided by the Oregon Flora Project here on campus: http://www.oregonflora.org/

Scene 4 is of Huckleberry, probably the second most important of the culturally significant plants from western Oregon.  This photo was taken right here on campus near the ALS building.  The map shows the distribution of huckleberry plants.  I chose a red symbol for the red huckleberries and blue to purple for the blue type of huckleberries.  This map is also interactive. You can click on the symbols and a popup will give information about the location. You can zoom in and out and there is an overview map and legend in the upper right corner. 

Scene 5 is the conclusion page where I listed the credits and a image of another culturally significant plant to peoples here in Oregon.  

At least 5 scenes. The content of the scenes can be obtained from Internet, historical archives, or even writing up by yourself. If you would like to use an external sources, please do mention their contribution in your credits information; (10 POINTS)

At least two types of layers (e.g., tileLayer or geojson layer). These layers can be made by yourself or from other web map providers; (10 POINTS)

The Camas distribution map and the Huckleberry distribution map are both geojson files. 

The storymap should at least include the following controls.



A favicon; (5 POINTS) For the favicon I used an acorn, which was another important food source for the western oregon tribes.

customized fonts for the texts of the storymap; (5 POINTS)

The fonts used in this story map include open_sansregular, sans-serif, both are easy to render on any device. 

A video or image on the front or end page; (5 POINTS)  There are 4 images in this story map.  The Cultural landscape, the camas flower, the huckberry branch, and the thimbleberry at the end. 

A social media button to share the storymap to Facebook or Twitter; (5 POINTS) To share the page with social media, click on the share button at the bottom right corner.  The facebook and twitter icons will link to social media.  

credit information or acknowledgement;   The credits are on Scene 5 of the story map. 

A github button to point to your github repository. There is a logo for Github at the bottom of the Credits along with a link to the storymap github respository. 

The structure of your github repository should like something below.

Deliverable
Once you complete this lab assignment, please make sure both the github repository and the web site work appropriately. Then, you will need to submit the url of the GitHub repository to Canvas Dropbox. (On the assignment tab, press the Submit Assignment button to submit. Please contact the instructor or TA if you have any difficulty.)  

I had a lot of difficulty with this project and was unable to get enough help to include leaflet, ajax and other code you provided to work properly.  I spent at least 3 weeks trying to get it all to work and I did learn a ton about building web maps!  This is the best I could do!
